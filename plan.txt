Define Project Scope:
Clearly define the scope of your e-commerce project. Decide on the types of 
products you'll sell, the features you want to include (e.g., product listing, 
search, cart, checkout), and any unique aspects you'd like to incorporate.

Set Up Development Environment:
Ensure you have a local development environment ready with the necessary tools. 
Since you're familiar with Apache and PHP, make sure you have them installed and 
configured properly. Additionally, set up a database (e.g., MySQL or MariaDB) to 
store product information, user data, and orders.

Plan the Database:
Design your database schema to store information about products, categories, 
users, orders, and any other relevant data. Plan out the tables, relationships, 
and attributes you'll need.

Create Database Tables:
Use SQL commands to create the necessary database tables based on your schema.
You can use tools like phpMyAdmin or command-line tools to execute your SQL scripts.

Develop the Models:
Create PHP classes (models) that interact with the database. These classes will
handle operations such as retrieving products, adding products to the cart,
placing orders, etc.

Build Views:
Develop the HTML templates (views) for your application's pages. Design the 
user interfaces for product listings, product details, cart, checkout, and any 
other pages. You can use HTML, CSS, and possibly a frontend framework like 
Bootstrap to style your views.

Implement Controllers:
Write PHP controllers that handle user requests and orchestrate the flow of data 
between models and views. Controllers should handle actions like adding items to
the cart, processing orders, and managing user authentication.

Implement Business Logic:
Incorporate business logic into your application. This could involve calculations 
for prices, tax calculations, order processing, and user authentication.

Test the Application:
Even if you're not focusing on unit testing, manually test your application 
to ensure it's working as expected. Verify that users can browse products, 
add items to the cart, and complete orders without errors.

Add User Authentication:
Implement user authentication to allow users to create accounts, log in, 
and manage their profiles. This is crucial for an e-commerce site.

Integrate Payment Gateway (Optional):
If you want to handle real payments, integrate a payment gateway (e.g., 
Stripe, PayPal) to process payments securely.

Optimize and Polish:
Review your code for optimization, security, and performance improvements. 
Ensure your application is responsive and works well on different devices.

Deploy to Production:
Once your application is ready, deploy it to a production server. Set up your 
server environment, configure your web server (Apache), and configure your domain.

Regular Maintenance:
Monitor your application for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and user feedback. 
Regularly update your codebase and respond to user needs.
